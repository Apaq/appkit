# Appkit

This is a libary for adding profound app support in your web application including an app store if you like. Appkit is inspired by how apps, widgets etc. are build and interregates in iOS and Android. It lets you build and use apps, widgets and extensions in your web application and delivers a unified way of exposing data between those.

This opens up for the possibility of sharing UI components with others via a centralized app store as they will all build on the same foundation.

## TODO

* Create a page for example of integration. 
* Create Simulator with UI support
